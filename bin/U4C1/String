Ans: As Java uses the concept of String literal. Suppose there are 5 reference variables, all
refer to one object "Masai". If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it
will be affected by all the reference variables. That is why String objects are immutable
in Java.

String=> The string created using the String
class is immutable.

An object of String is read-only in
nature.


String Builder=> The string created using StringBuilder is
mutable.

An object of StringBuilder is dynamic in
nature.
