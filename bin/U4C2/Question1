IS-A relationship: Whenever one class inherits another class, it is called an IS-A relationship.

HAS-A relationship: Whenever an instance of one class is used in another class, it is called HAS-A relationship.

example: For example, if a class Bulb inherits another class Device, then we can say that Bulb is having is-a relationship 
          with Device, which implies Bulb is a device.
          

Access modifier: The access modifiers in Java specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class.

There are four types of Java access modifiers:

1. Public - It can be access everywhere 
2. Private - It can be access only inside the same class.
3. default - It can be public inside the same package but act as private outside the package.
3. Protected - It is similar to default.
